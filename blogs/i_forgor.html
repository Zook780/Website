      <h1>=>> Top 10 bruh moments üò≥</h1>
      <p>1. My life üòÉüëç</p>
      <p>So the main point I have switched few schools until now and I can't socialze I need my own time to mix in with the crowd so few weeks ago I switched back to my past school (Context: School 1 - Junior KG to 2nd grade, School 2 - 3rd grade to 5th grade, School 3 - 6th grade to 9th grade) so I came back to School 2 and It was terrible the school doesn't have a ground bruh also not a computer lab BRUHHHH!, also I joined the schools at a very weird time when I got admission already 5-7 days of schools had passed but but but this is not the important part I was only able to speak with 2 guys one who I remembered and one who I forgot. Lets name the guy who I knew Sussy and the other one Baka so I sat down on my bench and every fuckin student is staring at me my social anxiety was triggered and I literally froze for 2 seconds. After the lecture was over baka turned to talk to me, He said he used to sit beside and when I told him that I forgot him his reaction was priceless XD, then sussy also talked to me I remembered him I talked to him a bit. The second day I talked to some more people and I was quiet the whole time (social anxiety) we were heading home he said that I have changed a lot, I asked him how I was, and the stuff he said I coudn't belive it üò≥ EVERY STUDENT IN MY CLASS WAS MY BEST FRIEND!! wut not kidding I only had 3 friends in School 3, yes. And I was A FUCKING BULLY!!! wuuuuuuuuuut, I used to beat sussy everyday in the school bus I would not even stop if he started crying wuuuuuuuuuuut??????? I am emotionally dead but this is too much and I wonder why my crush would talk to everyone except me ;(, also the best thing I don't remeber a thing about being a bully and making this much friends XD, I thought sussy and I became friend after talking about a topic, now I think that Zook was from another dimension or this Zook is from another direction. So yeah I feel guilty now. BYE :)</p>
