      <p>I may sound a little childish and embarassed in this blog because I am not used to discussing this stuff I usually have the grind mindset the chad mindset I also started a business,about that in another blog(I might be cringing at this stuff afterwards uhh yeah). So the story begins, I don't even know what to say bruh. The reason I am writing this blog is because I regret not confessing or even talking a word I have been an introvert from my childhood I would sit alone in family gatherings so making new friends is not easy for me, the other guy think that I am rude (I don't have any intentions to make this sound cool). So I am a little kid with small hairs playing pokemon games and studying and being the class topper, so lets name my crush jenny. Jenny was very social almost the whole bus was her friend , she was one year older than me she had short hair till her neck as I remember, but no I was a ego packed bitch I fought with a 8th grade guy when I was in 4th grade XD, what I did ? scratch his whole face so much that that every inch of his face had scratches, If she would have come to talk to talk to me I guess I would have confessed but she never did I don't know the reason was it because I was a dick and used to bully a kid or she expected me to come to her and start a conversation. She used to sit beside me when her stop was near but won't even face at me I really don't know the reason as I just remeber some people and my memories are hazy about School 1(read <a href="https://zook780.github.io/Website/blogs/i_forgor.html">this for reference</a>) she even used to talk to baka but not me ;( (read <a href="https://zook780.github.io/Website/blogs/i_forgor.html">this for reference</a>). I made this vlog because I was feeling sad and I recently changed school and I don't have any friends.</p>
