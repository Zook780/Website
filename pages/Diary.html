  <h1>Entry #1</h1>
  <p>Feb 12 10:52</p>
  <p>I am writing this at night, listening to music and being annoyed by spotify ads. Today's day was just normal just sitting in front of my computer and procrastinating and feeling lonely and sad, also I am not at my home I am over at my cousin's few days later it's my mother's heart surgery which is going to take over 6h. I am kinda nervous but somewhere I just don't care I don't know why I have became like this it's like I have become emotionally dead, I want to cry out loud but I can't. Still finding the meaning of life. I created this diary section to write things down becuase this is the only place where I can freely talk I can't talk with people irl like this. bye</p>
