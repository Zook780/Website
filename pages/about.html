    <h1>=>> Hmm so you want to know more about me ? ü§î</h1>
    <p><> It's funny because I don't tell anybody about me but here I am fine with telling "you" about who I really am.
	      So I am just a kid, who goes to school and stuff does normal stuff, things that catch my intrest are not intresting enough for another people or they just do it becuase they think its cool, for ex. programming, because there no one around me who shares the same intrests as me I have to forcefully act like I like the thing that others like.I don't want to be normal I want to bring a change even if it's un-noticeable or just a bit, I don't want to sit and watch tv with a fat stomach in my 40's. I really value and respect time I know the worth of every second the time we spend is never going to come back we waste our life in unproductive work everyday, which won't increase our worth or knowledge we don't value time. Here's a quote for ending this biography ? . ‚ùùThe world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking‚ùû ‚Äï Albert Einstein. This was me in my words.</p>
    <h1>=>> How did I get intrested in programming</h1>
    <img src="../img/program.gif" alt="img did not load :(" />
    <p><> I was just surfing youtube and I saw a video how to make a game in unity it was the first time I learned to program. C# was my first language, and as soon I saw a cube moving on my screen it was a very satisfying and that's how I got introduced to programming then I found my passion ?, then I learned many languages, made many projects also made an Operating system,XD which was so complex that my tiny brain could not handle it.</p>
