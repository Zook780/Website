    <h1>Hmm so you want to know more about me ?</h1>
    <p>It's funny because I don't tell anybody about me but here I am fine with telling "you" about who I really am.
	      So I am just a kid, who goes to school and stuff does normal stuff, I can't socialize the problem is not that I can't talk to people but is that things that catch my intrest are not intresting enough for another people or they just do it becuase they think its cool, for ex. programming. Even I can't get along with my relatives or cousins, I think because of this problem I developed another personality who adapts according to people around me, if the person doesn't care what's going on I become the same if someone is a nerd I too become a nerd, this is personality is what my others see but deep down I really don't care If I act as I want to I would be left alone, because there no one around me who shares the same intrests as me I have to forcefully act like I like the thing that others like. I think the second personality that I developed is the reason I am sad because I am not being myself and it's like living to please other people I can't change that even if I want to but aslo I want to be myself and don't give a fuck about other people and not be normal I want to bring a change even if it's un-noticeable or just a bit, I don't want to sit and watch tv with a fat stomach in my 40's. I also really value and respect time I know the worth of every second the time we spend is never going to come back we waste our life in unproductive work everyday, which won't increase our worth or knowledge we don't vlalue time. Life has no meaning just reproduce and fucking die thats what we have to do after you die no one's gonna care, plus I don't believe in god. Here's a quote for ending this. ❝The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking❞ ― Albert Einstein.This was me in my words.</p>

    <h1>How did I get intrested in programming</h1>
    <p>I was just surfing youtube and I saw a video how to make a game in unity it was the first time I learned to program. C# was my first language, and as soon I saw a cube moving on my screen it was a very satisfying and that how I got introduced to programming then I found my passion ?, then I learned many languages, made many projects also made an OS ,XD which did not work then many small projects, now this website and after this a game engine :D </p>
