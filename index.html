    <h1>=>> Something more about me</h1>
    <p><> I like dogs though I don't have any pets, and I can also solve a rubik's cube in 25 sec. I am that kind of a person, if something doesn't work I make it myself for example, Unity was not working on arch so I decided to make my own game engine and etc. Heres my list of music that I like <a href="./pages/musiclist.html">if you want to see I guess</a>. And yes I use arch "BTW", Last but not least I hate school.</p>
